Quoted from the documentation of the competition:
"The goal of the Challenge is to improve the procedure that produces the selection region. We
provide a training set with signal/background labels and with weights, a test set (without labels
and weights), and a formal objective representing an approximation of the median significance
(AMS) of the counting test. The objective is a function of the weights of selected events. We
expect that significant improvements are possible by re-visiting some of the ad hoc choices in the
standard procedure, or by incorporating the objective function or a surrogate into the classifier
design."
